Previous Session: ~5 exchanges

## Active Project
Path: D:\Projects-AI\autow-booking
CLAUDE.md: yes

## Session Summary
Applied responsive CSS styling using clamp()/min() functions to all share pages (estimate, invoice, vehicle-report). Removed redundant embedded media queries and added mobile-full-height class for iOS PWA compatibility. Build verified successful.

## Completed This Session
- [x] Read globals.css responsive variables for reference
- [x] Updated /share/estimate/[token] with clamp()/min() responsive styles
- [x] Updated /share/invoice/[token] with clamp()/min() responsive styles
- [x] Updated /share/vehicle-report/[token] with clamp()/min() responsive styles
- [x] Added mobile-full-height class to all share page containers
- [x] Simplified embedded <style> tags (kept only print and iOS Safari fixes)
- [x] Verified TypeScript type check passes
- [x] Verified Next.js build succeeds

## Current Task (Hand-off Point)
Task: Responsive design rollout to share pages complete
Status: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT
Next Action: Deploy to Vercel with `vercel --prod`

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel production
- [ ] Test on iPhone PWA to verify responsive scaling works
- [ ] Roll out responsive classes to staff pages if needed

## Key Decisions Made
1. Use inline clamp()/min() in styles object: Same pattern as disclaimer page for consistency
2. Removed embedded media query overrides: Inline responsive values handle scaling automatically
3. Added flex-wrap to two-column sections: Vehicle report stacks columns on mobile
4. Grid auto-fit with minmax: Parties section auto-stacks on narrow screens

## Files Modified
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| app/share/estimate/[token]/page.tsx | Full responsive styles with clamp()/min() |
| app/share/invoice/[token]/page.tsx | Full responsive styles with clamp()/min() |
| app/share/vehicle-report/[token]/page.tsx | Full responsive styles with clamp()/min() |

## Critical Context
- Vercel auto-deploy is NOT active - must use `vercel --prod` manually
- All three share pages now use the same responsive pattern as disclaimer page
- Responsive pattern: font-size uses clamp(min, preferred, max), spacing uses min(fixed, vw)
- Example: clamp(0.7rem, 3vw, 0.875rem) = min 11px, scales with viewport, max 14px

## Resume Instructions
The new session should:
1. Read this file
2. Summarize understanding (3-5 bullets)
3. State immediate next action
4. Ask "Ready to continue?" before proceeding
